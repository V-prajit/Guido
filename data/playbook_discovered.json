      "rationale": "This rule establishes the general strategic profile of the top 25% performers. It emphasizes strong tire management, consistent energy deployment, and a balanced aggressive approach to overtakes and defense, forming the foundation for high performance across races."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "uplift_win_pct": 20.0,
      "rationale": "Winning strategies in the early race deploy significantly more energy and are more aggressive in overtakes, yet maintain exceptionally high tire management. This indicates a focus on building an early lead without compromising long-term tire health, a key differentiator from losing strategies."

      "confidence": 0.88,
      "uplift_win_pct": 15.0,
      "rationale": "When battery power is scarce late in the race, winning drivers prioritize superior tire management to maintain pace and avoid further degradation (winners are 24% better than losers). They also deploy slightly more energy and ERS to sustain performance, rather than simply coasting."

      },
      "confidence": 0.89,
      "uplift_win_pct": 18.0,
      "rationale": "Even when tires are degraded, winners significantly increase energy deployment (40.5% vs 30.2% for losers) and maintain overtake aggression. This suggests using electric power to compensate for reduced mechanical grip and staying proactive, while still managing the remaining tire life better than competitors."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "uplift_win_pct": 12.0,
      "rationale": "Winning strategies show a higher overall overtake aggression. This rule promotes a more aggressive overtake approach in the mid-pack, backed by increased energy deployment to facilitate passes, while slightly lowering defense to prioritize gaining positions."

      "rationale": "Top performers exhibit significantly higher defensive intensity. When in a podium position, maximizing defense, supported by slightly higher energy deployment to fend off attacks and reducing unnecessary overtaking risk, is crucial for maintaining track position and securing a strong finish."
