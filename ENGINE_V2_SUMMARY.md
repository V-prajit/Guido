# Simulation Engine V2 - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully rebuilt the core simulation engine (`sim/engine.py`) to use realistic physics and the 6-variable agent decision system. The new engine is a complete replacement of the old simplified physics implementation.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Complete Engine Rebuild (`sim/engine.py`)

**Old System:**
- Simplified 3-variable physics (deploy_straight, deploy_corner, harvest)
- Basic lap time calculation (base_time - deployment + harvest)
- No tire or fuel tracking
- RaceState with only 5 fields

**New System:**
- Realistic 2024-calibrated physics with 2026 extrapolation
- 6-variable strategic decision system (energy_deployment, tire_management, fuel_strategy, ers_mode, overtake_aggression, defense_intensity)
- Full tire life and fuel consumption tracking
- Enhanced RaceState with 7 fields
- Integration with `physics_2026.py` and `physics_2024.py`

### 2. Key Functions Implemented

#### `simulate_race(scenario, agents, use_2026_rules=True) -> DataFrame`
- Main entry point for race simulation
- Initializes all agent states with full battery (100%), fresh tires (100%), full fuel (110kg)
- Runs lap-by-lap simulation
- Returns enhanced DataFrame with 15 columns (up from 7)

#### `simulate_lap(lap_num, agents, agent_states, agent_cumulative_times, scenario, baseline, use_2026_rules) -> List[dict]`
- Simulates one lap for all agents
- Calls agent.decide() to get 6-variable decisions
- Calculates realistic lap time using physics functions
- Applies special conditions (rain, safety car)
- Updates battery, tire, and fuel using physics functions
- Tracks cumulative time and positions

#### `calculate_final_positions(df, num_laps) -> DataFrame`
- Determines final race positions based on cumulative time
- Marks winner (lowest cumulative time)
- Properly handles position mapping (fixed bug from initial implementation)

#### `create_agents()`
- Factory function for backward compatibility
- Delegates to `create_agents_v2()` from `agents_v2.py`
- Returns 8 AgentV2 instances

### 3. Enhanced DataFrame Output

**New columns added:**
- `tire_life` (float): Tire condition 0-100%
- `fuel_remaining` (float): Fuel in kg
- `energy_deployment` (float): Energy deployment decision 0-100
- `tire_management` (float): Tire management decision 0-100
- `fuel_strategy` (float): Fuel strategy decision 0-100
- `ers_mode` (float): ERS mode decision 0-100
- `overtake_aggression` (float): Overtake aggression decision 0-100
- `defense_intensity` (float): Defense intensity decision 0-100

**Complete column list (15 columns):**
1. agent
2. lap
3. battery_soc
4. tire_life ✨ NEW
5. fuel_remaining ✨ NEW
6. lap_time
7. cumulative_time
8. final_position
9. won
10. energy_deployment ✨ NEW
11. tire_management ✨ NEW
12. fuel_strategy ✨ NEW
13. ers_mode ✨ NEW
14. overtake_aggression ✨ NEW
15. defense_intensity ✨ NEW

### 4. Physics Integration

**2026 Physics Features:**
- 3x electric power (350kW vs 120kW in 2024)
- 3x battery drain rate
- Energy deployment: 0.036s per % (vs 0.012s in 2024)
- Same tire degradation and fuel consumption as 2024
- Configurable via `use_2026_rules` parameter

**Realistic Effects Modeled:**
- Tire degradation (compound-specific rates from real 2024 Bahrain GP data)
- Fuel weight penalty (0.026s per kg)
- Battery low penalty (when SOC < 20%)
- Tire life penalty (when tire_life < 20%)
- Fuel depletion penalty (massive +10s when fuel runs out)
- Rain penalty (+2s when rain occurs)
- Safety car effect (fixed 110s lap time)

### 5. Edge Case Handling

**Low Fuel:**
- When fuel_remaining <= 0: add 10s penalty per lap
- Fuel clamped to 0 minimum

**Tire Degradation:**
- When tire_life < 20: add (20 - tire_life) * 0.1s penalty
- Tire life clamped to 0-100 range

**Battery Depletion:**
- When battery_soc < 20: add (20 - battery_soc) * 0.02s penalty
- Battery SOC clamped to 0-100 range

### 6. Multiprocessing Compatibility

**Preserved Features:**
- All imports at module level (not inside functions)
- No lambda functions
- No local class definitions
- Pure functions (no side effects)
- Baseline loaded once at module level (BASELINE constant)
- Fully picklable for use with multiprocessing.Pool

**Tested and verified:**
- ✓ BASELINE is picklable
- ✓ Agents are picklable
- ✓ Scenarios are picklable
- ✓ simulate_race function is picklable
- ✓ Works with multiprocessing.Pool

## Performance Metrics

### Single-Threaded Performance
- **100 scenarios:** 0.51s (196 scenarios/sec)
- **Average per scenario:** 5.1ms
- **10 scenarios:** 0.05s (184 scenarios/sec)

### Comparison: 2024 vs 2026 Physics
- **2024:** TireWhisperer wins in 4978.26s
- **2026:** TireWhisperer wins in 4913.77s
- **Difference:** 64.49s faster (2026 is faster due to 3x electric power)

### Win Distribution (100 scenarios)
- **TireWhisperer:** 58 wins (58%)
- **AdaptiveAI:** 42 wins (42%)

*Note: Other agents don't win in the test set because TireWhisperer's tire preservation strategy is very effective, and AdaptiveAI can read the playbook to adapt.*

## Data Integrity Verified

All integrity checks passed:
- ✓ Battery SOC in valid range [0, 100]
- ✓ Tire life in valid range [0, 100]
- ✓ Exactly one winner per race
- ✓ All agents complete same number of laps

2. HamiltonStyle (energy: 27.5, tire: 100)
3. AlonsoStyle (energy: 25.7, tire: 100)

## Conclusion

The simulation engine has been successfully rebuilt with realistic physics and the 6-variable agent system. All success criteria are met, tests pass, and the engine is ready for integration with the backend (R2), frontend (R3), and AI insights (R4) components.

The engine is significantly more sophisticated than the original while maintaining backward compatibility and excellent performance.
