    """
    Generate diverse race scenarios with deterministic seeding.

    Each scenario represents a unique race configuration with varying:
    - Race length (50, 57, or 70 laps)
    - Weather conditions (25% chance of rain)
    - Safety car events (33% chance)
    - Track characteristics (power/technical/balanced)
    - Ambient temperature

    Uses deterministic seeding (based on scenario ID) to ensure reproducibility
    across runs. This is critical for validation and benchmarking.

    Args:
        num_scenarios: Number of scenarios to generate

    Returns:
        List of scenario dictionaries, each containing:
            - id: Sequential scenario identifier (0 to n-1)
            - num_laps: Race length (50, 57, or 70 laps)
            - rain_lap: Lap when rain starts (None if no rain), 25% probability
            - safety_car_lap: Lap when safety car deploys (None if none), 33% probability
            - track_type: Track characteristic ('power' | 'technical' | 'balanced')
            - temperature: Ambient temperature in Celsius (20.0-35.0)

    Example:
        >>> scenarios = generate_scenarios(3)
        >>> len(scenarios)
        3
        >>> all('num_laps' in s for s in scenarios)
